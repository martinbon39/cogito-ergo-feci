# Expected output

Every command below was run on 2026-11-09 in a fresh clone of development commit [`08707a5`](https://github.com/martinbon39/ComputerUseHackaton/commit/08707a532478b8d7d6516cf3a584fa8ccc0520c3) (branch
`paper-repo` of the development repository). This repository's tree is that commit's tree plus the regenerated
`reproduce/EXPECTED_OUTPUT.md` and `docs/PROVENANCE.md`; only the link check reads them, and its output below is
that of the final tree. System Python 3.14.4, Linux x86-64,
CPU only, nothing installed. Every command exited 0 and `git status` stayed clean. CI runs the same checks on every
change to their inputs ([`reproduce.yml`](../.github/workflows/reproduce.yml), [`links.yml`](../.github/workflows/links.yml)).

Run on 2026-11-08 at about 10:05 UTC in a fresh clone of development commit [`6bb899f`](https://github.com/martinbon39/ComputerUseHackaton/commit/6bb899f4b2d824237c6d1f42700a21dfdd33ad24), before the repository was restructured
(`reproduce/guard_live.py` was then at its old path; its logic is unchanged).
`python3 reproduce/guard_live.py` uses the `claude` CLI (Claude Code, logged in) for fresh verifier calls. Both live
decisions matched the recorded ones. The `--api` path (Anthropic key through the OpenAI-compatible endpoint) was
**not run**, because no key was on the machine.
